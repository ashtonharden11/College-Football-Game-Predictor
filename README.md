# College-Football-Game-Predictor
Designed to guess the outcomes of upcoming college football games based on past team performance. The program analyzes statistics such as wins, losses, points scored, and defensive records to determine which team is more likely to win. Users type in the names of two teams, and the program analyzes their data to make a prediction.
